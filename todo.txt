[X] 501 add html and image.
[X] Change the run function.
[X]	Make a new client class and store the client_fd, client stuff that where inside the client.
[X]	Work on handleResponse.
[]	Create a response based on the client request
[]	Clean Up the Parsing
[X]	Make a separate requestParser class
[X]	readRequest in Client class
[]	sendRequest in Server class instead of Client???
[]	we should set default client_max_body if its not specified
	and probably limit the max size in config aswell
[]	Check if GET has a body, if so then send 400 BAD REQUEST
[]	CheckHeaders
[]	Assign a configuration server to the clients through the Server*
	One socket per unique IP/port and only use different configuration.
	Maybe the server map should become this: std::map<int, std::vector<Server*>> socketToServers;
	So we have a vector of servers for each socket.
[]	CGI 
[]	Maybe change the request class and requestParser so that request has an instance 
	of requestParser after all, i think its cleaner, because request will only contain the variables
	and client can acces it more easily

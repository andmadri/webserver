[X] 501 add html and image.
[X] Change the run function.
[X]	Make a new client class and store the client_fd, client stuff that where inside the client.
[X]	Work on handleResponse.
[X]	Create a response based on the client request
[X]	Make a separate requestParser class
[X]	readRequest in Client class
[X]	we should set default client_max_body if its not specified
	and probably limit the max size in config aswell
[X]	Assign a configuration server to the clients through the Server*
	One socket per unique IP/port and only use different configuration.
	Maybe the server map should become this: std::map<int, std::vector<Server*>> socketToServers;
	So we have a vector of servers for each socket.
[X]	CGI 

[?]	Clean Up the Parsing
[?]	Maybe change the request class and requestParser so that request has an instance 
	of requestParser after all, i think its cleaner, because request will only contain the variables
	and client can acces it more easily
[?]	Check if GET has a body, if so then send 400 BAD REQUEST
[?]	CheckHeaders

PROBLEMS:
[] we cannot connect two servers with same host and port but different server name: Bind failed with errno 98: Address already in use
[] When we have two servers only one works, the otherone returns 500 error for some reason, maybe we are not finding it properly
[] Post works sometimes??


[] Test with changes in the configuration file, whatever happens, it should not crash
[] Test with two servers and more
[] HTTP Redirections!!
[] Have a default server in case there is no configuration specified? Do we need to do this?
[] Test that the error codes are accurate
[] How do we close the webserver? SIGNALS?
[] Do we need actual forms or by uploading an image is good enough?
[] We need to find a solution to /favicon.ico cause it keeps causing issues, thought I solved it but apparently I did so not :/

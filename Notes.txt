CGI
-	CGI needs env variables from the config file like:
	METHOD = 
	SCRIPT_PATH =
	CONTENT_LENGTH =
	etc (need to figure out what i need and why)
-	Need the filepath
-	We should put a folder with scripts in the webserv repo
-	Think we should make a request class for parsing every client request. 
	If there is a script we pass the request to CGIHandler

NginX
-	command nginx -t to check for syntax error in configuration file
-	key - value pairs in .conf are called directives.

	directives:
		- listen 8080
		(listen on this port)

		- root /filepath
		(server will search in this directory for index.html file)

		- location /filepath
			root : filepath
		(server will append location to root)

		- location /filepath
			alias : filepath
		(server will serve alias filepath when /location is requested)

		- location /filepath
			try_files /filepath/ else use filepath = 404
		(server will try file if it exists / try this instead = return error)

		- location /filepath
			return 307 /filepath2
		(will redirect to filepath2)

Other
-	we should indeed already have a root directory in the webserv repo
-	multiple servers -- maybe use round robin approach???

-	CGI needs env variables from the config file like:
	METHOD = 
	SCRIPT_PATH =
	CONTENT_LENGTH =
	etc (need to figure out what i need)
-	Need the filepath
-	We should put a folder with scripts in the webserv repo
-	Think we should make a request class for parsing every client request. 
	If there is a script we pass the request to CGIHandler

# Webserver
A C++ project focused on building a lightweight HTTP web server capable of handling core HTTP methods such as GET, POST, and DELETE. The server is designed from scratch with support for multiple simultaneous clients using epoll for efficient I/O multiplexing. It also features CGI (Common Gateway Interface) execution for dynamic content handling. The goal of the project is to deepen understanding of low-level networking, HTTP protocol mechanics, and scalable server architecture.
